# Sentimental-analysis
Sentiment Analysis is a key task in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on identifying and extracting subjective information from text. It enables machines to determine whether a piece of writing expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiments 
# 📊 Sentiment Analysis Using Python (TextBlob)

Welcome! This repository contains an implementation of a basic **Sentiment Analysis** tool developed as part of an internship project at **CodeAlpha**. The goal is to classify textual data—such as reviews or tweets—into sentiment categories: **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using the **TextBlob** Python library.

## 🧠 What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment Analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that interprets and classifies emotions expressed in text. It’s widely used in business intelligence, customer feedback analysis, and social media monitoring.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- TextBlob  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Dataset

This project uses a sample or custom dataset composed of manually labeled short text reviews. The data includes tweets, sentences, or feedback that reflect varying sentiments.

## ⚙️ How It Works

TextBlob provides a simple API that evaluates polarity and subjectivity of text. It internally handles tokenization and sentiment scoring using pre-trained models.

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

text = TextBlob("This product is amazing!")
print(text.sentiment)
# Output: Sentiment(polarity=0.75, subjectivity=0.8)
